# Kingston Signs welcomes you to our lair!

Welcome to the **Kingston Signs** GitHub page!

This space contains internal and public-facing engineering work used in the design, development, and deployment of **machine control systems, automation workflows, and tooling** that support our modern sign-making process. Repositories here may include firmware, PLC logic, CNC/print automation, data pipelines, and experimental R&D projects.

Our focus is on **industrial automation solutions** for signmaking, **manufacturing efficiency**, and **real-world deployment**, not theoretical demos.
